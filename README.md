## Features

* **Folder Structure:** Well-defined folder structure. Devs can easily navigate it and add files where necessary.

* **Style Guide:** This kit helps you to build a Style Guide for your app. You can add your image and font assets, splash screen, color constants and theme data. These are available for use wherever required in your project.

* **API Calls:** The starter kit includes all the files you need for API handling. You can choose from [REST](https://restfulapi.net/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) depending on your project.

* **State Management:** Flutter Starter contains all the state management files, models and repositories for your app. We will use [Bloc](https://pub.dev/packages/bloc) for state management. 

* **Routers & Dependencies:** This kit allows you to quickly add routers for your app screens. Dependencies can also be added to your app by simply copy-pasting the install version from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/) into the designated file.

* **Testing & Deployment:** Lastly, you can test and deploy your app smoothly using Flutter Starter! Go to the test folder, add your test files and start writing test cases. Check out the [Android](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android) or [iOS](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/ios) pages to deploy your app.

## Installing & Usage

Go to [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) and install Flutter on your system. 

To run the project, run:
```
bash run_script.sh
```

>:bulb: You can build apps with Flutter using any text editor combined with our command-line tools. We use VS Code since it is lightweight.
